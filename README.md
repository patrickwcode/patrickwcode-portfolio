My website showcases completed projects in graphic design,
motion graphics, and front end development at NBCUniversal.

I created apps for the InTouch touchscreen system using
React that covers topics such as the FIFA World Cup and
weather.  The daypart forecast app uses The Weather
Channel's API to fetch JSON data and icons, then renders
the 24-hour forecast based on the news station's location.

I have a long-term React project finished that searches all apps
on Steam and displays the achievements.  These can be sorted
alphabeticlally or by percentage.  There is also a minimal
view that shows a grid of icons and the details are visible
once clicked upon.  I use Node.js to run an Express server, 
which fetches JSON data from the Steam Web API.
