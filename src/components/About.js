        Since the age of 7, I have been fascinated with computers and
        programming. My neighbor was a computer wizard, who opened the portal to
        this evolving passion. I started making index cards for terms such as
        CPU, RAM, and ROM to memorize for fun. I was able to attach an image to
        these components when he showed me his top of the line gaming rig. I
        knew right then and there that I had to build a computer for myself one
        day.
        <br></br>
        <br></br>
        Fast forward to college in 2010. My dream has come true and I am
        pursuing my other dream of graduating with a Bachelor's in Film and
        Computer Science. Java was a required language to learn and I didn't
        grasp it very easily. My interest in programming plateaued due to this.
        Editing and graphic design slowly became the front runner for me.
        <br></br>
        <br></br>I graduated the following year in spring and was ready to work.
        I decided to look for graphic design jobs since I felt more confident in
        this field. In 2015, I landed my dream job of working for NBC Arthouse
        as a graphic designer. Throughout the years, I have fine tuned my craft
        and expanded into many new areas. One of them being ReactJS.
        <br></br>
        <br></br>I took it upon myself to learn JavaScript and React and apply
        it to the InTouch touchscreen system that on-air talent use. JavaScript
        felt much more natural to me, especially not having to worry about
        compiling code constantly. Eventually, I started building apps to help
        cover topics like the FIFA World Cup and weather. The blend of design
        and programming put me in total bliss.
        <br></br>
        <br></br>
        Instead of choosing between my two passions, why not combine them as a
        software developer?
